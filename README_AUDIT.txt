AUDIT RESULT — FIXED LANDING
Channel detected: @sizning_kanalingiz

Key fixes applied:
1) Removed raw https://t.me links from HTML — now stored in Base64 and opened via JS.
2) Robust deep-link: try tg:// first, then https://t.me/... (opens in new tab to escape WebView).
3) Android Chrome intent:// path when possible (fastest handoff to Telegram app).
4) FB/IG in-app detection and safe fallback.
5) Android-gating helper text; separate fallback button for non-Android users.
6) Added Meta Pixel custom event 'GoToTelegram' on click to measure real transitions.
7) Kept your styles and assets; replaced inline onclick handlers with class-based listeners.

How to change channel:
- In index.html we auto-embedded your current username: @sizning_kanalingiz
- To switch, search & replace 'sizning_kanalingiz' or update __TG_SCHEME_B64 / __TG_WEB_B64 with Base64 of tg:// and https:// links.

Deploy tips:
- Attach a custom domain via Cloudflare for better delivery.
- Keep one pinned post in the channel with a clear APK button.
